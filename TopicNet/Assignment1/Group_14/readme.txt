Q1-----------------------Simulation of Virtual Circuit Switching-----------------------

*****Execution instructions*****
1. While running the binary files, all flags must be correct and ordered.
2. Filenames passed as argument must stored in local disk.
3. <executable file> -top <filename> -conn <filename> -rt <filename> -ft <filename> -path <filename> -flag hop -pq 1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****Data Structures used*****
C++ STL library is used in most module definitons.
The file I/O is done with the help of "fstream".


Q2----------------------Simulation of Queuing Theory---------------------------

1. All cases(A,B,C) are contained in the single file.
2. Program require case Number, arrival Rate, Departure Rate as input.
3. Arrival rate, Departure rate and duration must be in long int format.
4. Arrival rate defines in one second how many passengers are comming.
5. Departure rate defines in one second how many passengers get departed from the system.
6. Duration defines for how much duration System would run.
7. Output of the program contain all the answers of the questions mentioned in the question.
